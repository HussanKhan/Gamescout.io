This site was designed to find and sort nearly a thousand video game deals everyday. The site includes images, user reviews, video reviews, and links to buy the products.

I highly recommend you try out the site yourself.

I fully built both the responsive front-end and back-end of this website. 

I used Flask with PostgreSQL in the back-end with Beautiful Soup 4 for web scraping.

A "cronjob" is used in an AWS Lightsail Ubuntu instance to run a python script to update the website.

The back-end of the site is heavily automated, so no administration is necessary from me. 

The front-end of the site is fully responsive with thoughtful desktop and mobile user interfaces.

The front-end is built using KnockoutJS and mostly everything is handled through ajax calls.

The site is an overall success and has been performing well so far for months. less
